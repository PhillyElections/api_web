# Where to vote
You can use this tool to find your polling place. It uses GSG's 
[election geocoder](http://gis.phila.gov/arcgis/rest/services/ElectionGeocoder/GeocodeServer/findAddressCandidates)
and the City Commissioners' [polling places api](http://phlapi.com/pollingplaces/).
It is not in production use and was only created as a backup in case there is an issue
with the [official app](http://www.philadelphiavotes.com/index.php?option=com_voterapp&tmpl=component).
